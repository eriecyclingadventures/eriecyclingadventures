        When Lake Erie Cyclefest began back in the summer of 2017, its mission was a simple equation of good health, community and business through cycling. Over the last four years, that equation has served us well. Lake Erie Cyclefest, has encouraged thousands and thousands of people - all ages, shapes and sizes - to ride their bicycles to and around all corners of Erie County.
